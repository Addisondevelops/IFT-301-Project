<h1>The Physical Needs of an Australian Shepherd</h1>
<p>The physical needs of an australian shepherd are very intensive and need to be recognized or else this breed may not be right for you. <br/>
Since the Australian Shepherd is a working dog that need over 2 hours of exercise on a daily basis to stay healthy mentally and physically. <br/>
If you're unable to exercise these for 2 hours a day because of time restraints, many of them will develop destructive behaviors and attitudes. <br />
The physical needs can be met through a job, intensive outdoor exercise, fetch, agility, trick training, etc.. This will help give the dog something to do, drain energy, and make them well mannered. <br />
Overall, knowing the energy needs of an Australian Shepherd is extremely important because owners who have not done proper research on this aspect, often times depart ways with their dogs.
