  <h1>Australian Shepherd Intelligence</h1>
  <p>The Australian Shepherd is an extremely intelligent breed of dog. They are natural herding/working dogs that have the mental capacity to learrn thousands of commands and tricks <br/>
    They are so smart they can hear a command once and learn it, it doesn't take much for the Australian Shepherd to adapt and learn what the trainer is saying. <br/>
    They are also very emotionally intelligent and can sense someone's energy, whether that's happy, or sad; they will always be there to play or show comfort as times of need.
