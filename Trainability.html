<h1>Australian Shepherd Trainability</h1>
<p>Australian Shepherds are tricky to train at time. In many ways they are very easy dogs to train and very adaptive to their environment and commands. <br />
They can be easily trained by an experienced dog owner who has previous experience with some dog training. Although they are very intelligent they do need to have a patient trainer <br />
There energy and stubborness can make training them a difficult tasks at time. They are very easily distracted by other people and animals. <br />
And there stubborn behavior makes them give up on tricks fairly quickly if the trainer is not strong and confident, as well has the dog's trust. <br />
Overall, we recommend these dogs to not be owned by first time dog owners because of their high energy but they are very trainable with a strong and determined trainer that's patient enough to really utilize their intelligence. </p>
